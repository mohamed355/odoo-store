In recent times, Odoo's announcement of significant policy changes regarding free modules within its system has sparked widespread controversy and dissent within the Odoo user community. This decision to remove free modules that contribute to enhancing the functionality of the community edition of Odoo has raised concerns about its potential negative impact on the community's freedom and innovation.

Open-source communities serve as vital hubs for numerous successful technological projects, characterized by collaboration and open exchange of knowledge and resources. Among these communities, Odoo stands out as a prominent example, where developers and users collaborate to continuously improve and enhance the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.

However, Odoo's recent decision to remove free modules represents a progressive step rather than a progressive one, as it undermines access to cutting-edge technologies and restricts innovative opportunities for developers and users. It is unacceptable for financial barriers to impede innovation and technological advancement.

Odoo must take actions that reflect its respect for the freedom and diversity of the community, and promote open exchange and collaboration among its members. The policies adopted by the company should be aimed at supporting and enhancing the growth of the community, rather than restricting its freedom and access to tools necessary for development and innovation.

In response, the launch of a repository on GitHub to host the deleted free modules emerges as a revolutionary initiative aimed at preserving the community's freedom and fostering exchange and collaboration among its members. It provides an open platform for developers and users to continue their work and access essential modules for their projects without financial constraints.

Therefore, we call for solidarity and collaboration in opposing these oppressive policies and defending the freedom and diversity of the community. We believe that the strength of communities lies in their unity and diversity, compelling us to stand together to protect our principles and rights as members of the Odoo community.
